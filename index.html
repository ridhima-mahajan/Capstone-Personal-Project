            <p>I started coding since i was 15 years old and have been learning little by little everyday and adding to my knowledge 
                and skills. Coding intrigues my thinking ability, brings exposure to new possibilities and solutions.

            <img class="skills-img" src="./Assets/gifs/communication.gif" alt="spongebob communication gif">
            <p>I have participated in school assemblies and inter-school competitions like DECLAMATION and DEBATE from First grade
                and that has essentially helped in improving my communication skills and presentation abilities.

            <p>My favourite free time is binge watching various web series and dramas. Currently I am into Kdramas a lot. My favourite
                actor is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burak_Deniz" target="_blank" style="color:darkgreen; text-transform: uppercase;">Burak Deniz</a> , his acting is spectacular and beyond my words of praise.
